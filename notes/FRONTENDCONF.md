Could you provide the following info by May 29 so that we can promo your session before hand?

Title: How to Build a Terminal Agent (Like Claude Code or Codex)

Paragraph description: Ever wondered how tools like Claude Code or Codex actually work? In this hands-on workshop, you’ll build your own terminal agent in TypeScript—capable of executing commands locally or on a remote server. You’ll choose the LLM and decide exactly where it runs, giving you a behind-the-scenes look at how AI coding agents really function.

Paragraph about you: Hey there—I’m Garrison Snelling, the founder of ComputeSDK. I’ve spent the past five years in the devtooling space at StackBlitz and LocalStack. Most recently, I started building ComputeSDK: the primitive the world needs to power the next generation of AI-enabled applications. Outside of work, I live in Opelika, Alabama with my wife and two children, where we walk everywhere and eat fresh croissants daily.

Technologies Used: TypeScript, LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Prerequisites: An account with OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. (We'll be using Vercel's AI SDK.)

Time that works best for your session: 7:00 PM CEST (12:00 PM in Alabama / 10:00 AM in San Francisco)

Thanks!
